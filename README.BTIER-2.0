BTIER 2.x differs from BTIER 1.X in several ways.
The most significant change is that BTIER 2.x no longer directly supports the use of files as backend devices.
The VFS interface has been removed to allow much increased performance.

BTIER 2.x is able to handle up to a million IOPS, provided that the backend devices can handle that workload.
BTIER 1.X is able to handle 250K writes and 100K random reads.
So the performance gain is significant.
